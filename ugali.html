                <h2>What is ugali?</h2>
                <p>
                    Ugali is a dish made by cooking maize flour (course cornmeal similar to polenta in texture) into a type of mush. It is a popular meal in most African countries where it goes by different names. Due to its relatively neutral taste, and ease of preparation, it is popularly served as a side dish alongside vegetables such as sukuma wiki (collard greens), soups, and stews. In Kenya, ugali is considered one of the national dishes and is eaten almost daily by every Kenyan.

                <h3>Method</h3>
                <h5>Step 1</h5>
                <p>
                    Using a medium-sized and deep pot, bring water to a boil. The water needs to be very hot. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and set Â½ a cup of water aside.
                </p>
                <h5>Step 2</h5>
                <p>
                    To the pot, add the maize flour (coarse cornmeal), a quarter of a cup at a time, and use a wooden spoon to stir, using circular motions so it resembles a thick porridge. Be careful and keep a distance as it will start to bubble.
                </p>
                <h5>Step 3</h5>
                <p>
                    Continue adding the maize flour or coarse cornmeal a little at a time, and stirring until all of it has been used up and the mixture is firm. Using the wooden spoon, poke small holes on the surface of the ugali and add the previously preserved hot water to the holes. Cover and allow to cook stirring halfway through, or until all the water has evaporated and the bottom of the pan is browned up but not burning.
                </p>
                <h5>Step 4</h5>
                <p>
                    Next, run the wooden ugali spoon under tap water (this helps with the shaping). Continue to shape it in the pot until you have an almost perfectly round ball. Transfer the pot from the stove and tip it upside down to a plate. Serve ugali hot, with your favourite dishes.

                <h2>Beef Stew</h2>
                <p>
                    Just like with most African recipes, actually all recipes, there is no cast in stone way of making East African or Kenyan beef stew. Variations are normally based on the type of vegetables used. The base of the stew is tomatoes and the key is in using fresh vegetables, which will depend on the seasonality.

                    The ''how to'' make East African or Kenyan beef stew has evolved over time. Nowadays, most people use stock cubes or Royco (a type of flavor enhancer made out of cornstarch, herbs, and spices). Since we are making the healthy version, we will only be using natural ingredients for this recipe
                </p><br><br>


                <h3>Method</h3>
                <h5>Step 1</h5>
                <p>
                    Use your chopping board to cut your beef into stewing chunks. Season it with a teaspoon of salt, curry powder, turmeric, smoked paprika, and black pepper, and allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight for best results.
                </p>
                    <img class="image-tomatoe" src="https://weeatatlast.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/process.jpg">
                <h5>Step 2</h5>
                <p>
                    Using your blender or hand mixer, process onion, the remaining salt, tomato, red bell pepper, and tomato puree. Use a pestle and mortar to grind the garlic and ginger. Alternatively, process the garlic and ginger with the tomatoes in the blender if you prefer.

                </p>
                <h5>Step 3</h5>
                <p>
                    Under high heat, heat a medium-sized pot or pan then add the oil. Add the beef chunks and allow them to brown (about 2-3 minutes) on each side. Turn and allow the other side to brown for about 2 minutes, then stir in the garlic and ginger. Fry for a further 2 minutes until fragrant then add the blended tomato mixture and stir.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>If making this on the stovetop,</strong> simmer for 30-45 minutes, stirring from time to time. You can add more water if you prefer your stew to have more sauce or if it is too dry. Please bear in mind that the total time will depend on how tough or soft your meat is, so feel free to add more liquid and increase the cooking time if too tough, and vice versa.
