                        Pilau has a wonderful balance of flavors. It is a festive dish, which is never missing during special occasions or events. Its made with rice cooked in a well-seasoned broth of Meat or chicken. Unlike the Indian pilau, the East African version does not use curry and itâ€™s less spicy.

                        Rice is, without a doubt, one of my favorite food in the world. Not only is it my to-go dish when I need to prepare a quick meal, but it can easily be turned into an elegant dish for special occasions.

                        With the right combination of spices, plain rice can be turned into the main attraction like this Rice Pilau or the West African jollof rice, my go-to one-pot chicken and rice, and much more!

                    <h3>Note: What Makes Pilau Brown?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The brown color of the pilau comes from caramelizing the onions, browning the meat until it becomes really browned.

                        The pilau seasoning or pilau masala also adds a bit of color to the rice as well as a unique flavor.
